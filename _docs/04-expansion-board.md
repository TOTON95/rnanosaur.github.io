{: .notice--warning}

Before assembling NanoSaur you need to solder the expansion board to connect the NVIDIA Jetson Nano to the Adafruit motor board.

You have tree ways to build the expansion board:
1. Assembly on a matrix board the adapter
2. Make a PCB and solder it
3. Buy the adapter

If you chose the number **1.** follow this steps otherwise let's go to the [next step](/assembly).

# Layout

**:floppy_disk: Download** the Nanosaur expansion board [**schematics.pdf**](https://github.com/rnanosaur/nanosaur-exp-board/releases/latest/download/combined.pdf)
{: .notice--success}

The expansion board is a simple adapter to connect the motor controller and the LCDs to the NVIDIA Jetson.

* I2C bus 0
* I2C bus 1
* 2 GPIO

# Board

**:floppy_disk: Download** the Nanosaur expansion board **STEP** file [**nanosaur-exp-board.step**](https://github.com/rnanosaur/nanosaur-exp-board/releases/latest/download/nanosaur-exp-board.step)
{: .notice--success}

The PCB Layout will be like the pictures below:

{% include gallery id="pcb_expansion_board" caption="PCB expansion board" %}

The size is **20mm x 80mm** with 4 M2 mounting holes

## Gerbers

If you want print by yourself the expansion board, you need only to download the file below

# Assembly

To assembly the expansion board, is simple you need only to weld the female 2x20 connector and a switch.
